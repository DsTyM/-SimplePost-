    SimplePost is a web simple post management system.<br>
    It is actually a simple CRUD web application implemented in Java EE (now called Jakarta EE) using
    MVC Architecture.<br>
    It uses JSP files as the View, it uses Servlets as the Controller and it uses simple Java Classes as the Model.<br>
    It uses MySQL as the database and JDBC to connect Java with MySQL.<br>
    It also uses HTML and CSS for the View on the JSP Files just to project the content. But it strongly focuses on
    the back-end and not at the front-end.<br>
    I tried to use Clean Code and Best Practices as much as I could on the back-end (not on the front-end).<br>

    All users that access the website can view the posts.<br>
    The already logged in users can also edit and delete the posts that have uploaded themselves
    and they can also create new posts.<br>
